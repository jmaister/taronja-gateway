# Installation

### Quick Install (All Platforms)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/jmaister/taronja-gateway/raw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This script detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release, and installs it to your system path.

### Windows Installation

```bat
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://github.com/jmaister/taronja-gateway/raw/main/scripts/install.bat' -OutFile 'install.bat'" && install.bat
```

The Windows installer places the binary in `%USERPROFILE%\bin`. Add this directory to your PATH to use `tg` from anywhere.

# Commands

The Taronja Gateway CLI provides the following commands:

*   **Run the Gateway:**
    ```bash
    ./tg run --config ./sample/config.yaml
    ```
    This command starts the Taronja API Gateway using the configuration file specified by the `--config` flag.

*   **Add a new user:**
    ```bash
    ./tg adduser <username> <email> <password>
    ```
    This command creates a new user in the database with the provided username, email, and password.

*   **Show the current version:**
    ```bash
    ./tg version
    ```

# Building and Releasing

## Development Builds

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Generate test coverage report
make cover

# Run in development mode with automatic restart on file changes
make dev
```

## Release Process

Taronja Gateway uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for building and publishing releases.

```bash
# Install GoReleaser
make setup-goreleaser

# Check GoReleaser configuration
make release-check

# Create a local snapshot release (for testing)
make release-local

# Build Docker image locally
make release-docker
```

## GitHub Releases

When a new version is ready to be released:

1. Tag the commit with a semantic version:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. Create a new release on GitHub, pointing to the created tag.

3. The GitHub action will automatically:
   - Build binaries for multiple platforms
   - Create Docker images
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Publish all artifacts to the GitHub release

## Geolocation Configuration

Configure IP geolocation services in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
geolocation:
  iplocateApiKey: ${IPLOCATE_IO_API_KEY}  # Optional: Use iplocate.io
```

- **With API key**: Uses [iplocate.io](https://www.iplocate.io) (more accurate, requires API key)
- **Without API key**: Uses [freeipapi.com](https://freeipapi.com) (free, basic accuracy)

Geolocation data is cached for 7 days to optimize performance and reduce API calls.
