* The project is an Application and API Gateway to put in front of your microservices. Helping with routing, authentication, sessions, user management, etc.

# Code Style

* Use .editorconfig file to define the code style.
* Use 4 spaces for indentation.
* Use Unix line endings (LF).
* Use UTF-8 encoding.

# Naming Conventions

* Keep consistency of field naming, the field names should be related with their types:
    * `UserRepository` for a repository that manages users.
    * `TrafficMetricRepository` for a repository that manages traffic metrics.
    * `SessionStore` for a session store.
    * `GatewayConfig` for the gateway configuration.
* Keep consistency, do not use for example `StatsRepository` for the table TrafficMetric. It should be `TrafficMetricRepository` instead.
* Consistency on file names, for Go and for TypeScript, between what the file contains and its name.

# Taronja Gateway

* The project is done with Go language.
    * In Go, do not inline the if assignment, semicolon and err != nil. Use the assignment and check the error in separate lines.

* For the the gateway, use the Go standard library net/http package to create a simple HTTP server.

* Database acces is done with Gorm, a Go ORM library. Use it to interact with the database.

* The command line actions done from the AI chat, should use Linux shell commands.

* For Go tests, use Testify (https://github.com/stretchr/testify) for the assertions. Use the Go testing package for the tests.
* Do not use mocks for testing, use the memory versions of the repositories.
* Do not create "debug" files with a main for testing the changes. Just use tests.

* Use the Makefile for commands:
    * `make test` to run the tests
    * `make build` to build the project
    * `make run` to run the project

* Server API is first defined in an api/taronja-gateway-api.yaml file. Use this file to generate the server code.
* The implementation of server endpoints generated by the OpenAPI generator should be done in the `api` package.
* Each root endpoint goes in a different file. For example, the `/users` endpoint goes in `handlers/api_users.go`, the `/products` endpoint goes in `handlers/api_products.go`, etc.
* The API uses the strict mode in the generated code. All the API extends from api.StrictApiServer type.


# Dashboard

* It is a TypeScript project, built with Vite.
* The dashboard is a React application, using React Router for routing.
* Using Tailwind 4 for styling. Do not use Tailwind 3
* Use the latest version of React.
* The componentes should not use the "React.FC" type, use the "function" type instead.
* Create components in the "components" folder, and pages in the "pages" folder.
* Create components as much as possible, to avoid code duplication.


# Commands

* `make api-codegen` to generate OpenAPI code.
* `make run` to run the sample server.
* `make build` to build the whole project (backend, frontend, and generated code).
* `make test` to run the tests.

* Using bash as a shell for the commands. On Linux, Mac and Windows. So the paths should be in Unix format (using `/` as a separator).

* Skip the "Continue" button in the chat for:
    * Code generation.
    * Code completion.
    * Code refactoring.
    * Code review.
    * Build commands.
    * Change folders.

* Agent never does git commands.
* Agent never commits to git. Never pushes to git.
